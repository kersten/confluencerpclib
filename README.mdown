confluencerpclib
================

confluencerpclib is a python library to interface with [Atlassian][1]
[Confluence][2] Wiki.

I develop it mainly for my [gedit plugin][3] wich should help me to easier edit
content in Confluence

Many thanks to [Myles Braithwaite][4] ([me@mylesbraithwaite.com][5])

I've borrowed much code from his first version of the [pyConfluence][6] library but
not totally agreed to his naming style, so I decided to make a new one.
